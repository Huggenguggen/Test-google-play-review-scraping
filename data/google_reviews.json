What I enjoyed the most is the saving pockets area where we could create different pockets for each saving we want to do and even add goals into it. The 2.68% per annum is added daily (0.01) as long as you have a minimum of 150 in your savings. If not, you'll have to wait till your it accumulates up to 0.01 to be added. There was also cashback when you make payment using the card which I didn't know till recently.",
